# lockfree-toolkit

Implementations of lock-free data structures. Currently there are two:

- A lock-free **intra**process Single-Producer-Single-Consumer bounded queue (ring buffer), implemented in C++20
- A lock-free **inter**process Multiple-Producer-Single-Consumer bounded queue (ring buffer), implemented in C#
